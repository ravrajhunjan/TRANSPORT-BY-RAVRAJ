TRANSPORT
Transport can be defined as the movement of people, animals, goods or services from one place to another. 
There are three broad modes of transport. These include: 
1. Land transport: 
(i) Human transport
(ii) Animal transport
(iii) Road transport
(iv) Railway transport
(v) Pipeline transport
2. Air transport 
3. Water transport

LAND TRANSPORT
Land transport is a kind of transport that takes place on land surface. Categories of land transport include the following:  
Human transport/human portage
Human transport or human portage is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle power, in the form of walking, and running from one place to another. a person who carris things is called a porter.
Animal transport 
Refers to the means of transport where by animals are used for movement of people and goods. Example camel is the animal used in desert for transport, donkeys, and horses.

Advantages of animal transport
•	animals are quicker than human being
•	they carry heavier and larger loads than human beings
•	animals are capable of being used in hostile conditions like deserts 
•	it is relatively cheap and more developmental than human beings 

Road transport 
Road transport involves the use of various vehicles such as motor cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, carts etc. All the movement of goods begins and ultimately ends by making use of roads.

Advantages of road transport
1. Road transport is flexible.it can be constructed to many places and can serve individual homestead
2. It offers a variety of transport facilities giving a customer a wider choice of the type of facility to se.
3.  It is faster and cheaper at shorter distances
4.  It is suitable for delivering perishable goods at short distance e.g. vegetables, milk, fruits
5.  Road transport is easy to construct and run compared to railway transport or air means.
7. No time schedule is required for vehicle to run on the road

Disadvantages of road transport
1. It is handle a specific and limited amount of goods 
2. It is too risk especially for delicate goods. This can Cause breaking or destruction of goods
3. Weather conditions tend to disrupt road transport especially during the rainy season
4. Goods transported by road face the risk of being stolen by robbers while on transit.
5. The speed of motor transport is comparatively slow and limited compared to air transport.
6.  Motor vehicles emit gases which contribute to air pollution and noise pollution.
7. Road transport face the problem of congestion (traffic jam)

Railway transport 
This involves carrying of goods and passengers by train. 
Advantages of railway transport 
1.  It is least affected by weather conditions such as rain, fog, etc.
2.  Railway transport is cheap for carrying bulky goods over long distances.
3. Railway is the safety form of transport, there is low occurrence of accident.
4. The carrying capacity of the railways is extremely large.
5. It is not affected by the problem of congestion as is the case with road transport.
6. Once railways have been constructed its operating costs are very low

Disadvantages of railway transport 
1. The railway are expensive to build.
2. Railway transport is not flexible. Its routes and timings cannot be adjusted to individual requirements.
3. It is not suitable for transportation of perishable goods like milk, vegetables and meat as they can easily go bad while on transit
4. It is not efficient and not time serving. In the developing world for instance train services are too slow and backwards. 
5. It causes inconveniences and delays

WATER TRANSPORT
Water transport is the movement of goods and people by means of a watercraft, such as a boat, ship or sailboat, over a body of water, such as a sea, ocean etc.
Water transport consists of: 
•	inland water transport which involve the use of rivers, lakes and canals
•	ocean transport involves the use of seas and oceans

Advantages of water transport 
1.  Water transport is cheap which does not require any cost of construction and maintenance of water ways.
2.  It can carries heavy and bulky goods such as coal, machinery, hardware and timber over long distances.
3.  There is minimal congestion in water transport compared to road transport
4. There are minimal risks of accidents and breakdowns
5.  It is suitable for transportation of fragile or breakable goods, such as glass, since there is very limited shaking and jolting on the waterways.
6. Water navigation facilities do not need frequent repairs and maintenance

Disadvantages of water transport 
1. Water transport is very slow mode of transport
2. Perishable or urgently required goods such as newspaper cannot be transported through this means.
3. Modern shipping vessels are very expensive. Port construction, as well as purchase of loading and unloading machinery is also expensive.
4. Water transport system cannot be constructed anywhere. It can only be done in a limited area which is served by water bodies.
5. There is sometimes a problem of strong winds and storms, which greatly interfere with the shipping schedule.
6. Some water bodies are infested with dangerous animals such as hippopotamuses and crocodile.

Pipeline transport: Pipeline transport is the transportation of Liquid and gases goods through a pipe. Example The Tanzania Zambia Mafuta (TAZAMA) pipeline which runs from the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Ndola in Zambia, covering 1710 km, and the local Songogas pipeline from Songosongo to Dar es salaam.
Advantages of pipeline transport 
1. It is less expensive to establish and maintain
2. It has higher ability to cover longer distances
3. It is not affected by congestion as is the case with road transport.
4. Is not affected by adverse weather events such as floods, heavy rains, fog, etc.
5. Accidents and theft are greatly reduced compared to other form of transport.

Disadvantages of pipelines transport 
1.  Environmental pollution can occur if the pipeline leakages is not well maintained and repaired timely.
2. Pipelines are mainly convenient for transporting fluids.
3. Underground pipelines cannot be easily repaired and detection of leakage is also difficult.
4. Pipelines are expensive and they take a long time and intensive labour to build.
5. They have fixed carrying capacities which cannot be exceeded
6.  It is not effective and efficient in areas, which are too mountainous

AIR TRANSPORT
This is the movement of people, goods or services from one place to another through the air. It is the fastest mode of transport and involves the use of aircraft such as airplanes, helicopters and hot air balloons. 

Advantages of air transport 
1. It is the fastest mode of transport.
2. Low risk of damage since there is no rough movement and goods do not stay long in transit
3. It is free from physical barriers such as mountains, forests, rivers, etc.
4. It is comfortable and less tiresome especially over long distances 
5. It is flexible since the routes and planes can be swapped when need arises.
7. Can be used to provide relief in major disasters areas e.g. during floods, epidemics, tsunami
8. Air transport facilitate tourism in many part of the word

Disadvantages of air transport 
1.  It is much affected by weather conditions. When storms, fog, mist, snow, heavy rain or any signs of unfavorable weather conditions are detected, take off of planes is delayed, routes changed or flights cancelled.
2. It cannot transport bulky or heavy goods or poorly packed goods.
3. It requires a large amount of capital investment in the construction and maintenance of aero planes.
4. Training of the personnel in the aviation sector is a very expensive.
5. It contributes to air pollution as a result of burning fuel
6. Insecurity problems are also experienced in air transport. There are cases of hijacking and terrorist attacks.
7.  Airports are normally built far from town, therefore time is lost in taking goods to the airports.

The Importance of Transport in Tanzania and East Africa 
1. It is Source of employment in the country
2. Promotes trade and commerce 
3. They facilitate spread of technology 
4. Transportation encourage development of tourism in the country
5. Encourages the development of industries through the supply of raw materials and      transportation of manufactured goods to the markets.
6. Encourages development of town centers especially railway stations and road junctions. 
7. Source of government revenue

Problems Facing Transport in East Africa 
1. Lack of capital for investing in development of transport systems
2. Climatic conditions like very heavy rains lead to floods affecting the development of transort
3. High fuel costs
4. Political conflicts lead to destruction of transport lines.
5. Impassable waterways
6. Thick vegetation
7. Rough terrain
8. Corruption and embezzlement

Measures taken to address the problems of transport industry in Tanzania include the following: 
1. Formulation of policies and laws that promote the development of the transport industry.
2. Punishment to government officials involved in corruption scandals pertaining to embezzlement of funds allocated for construction of transport
3. The East African countries should build railway lines with the same gauges and trucks so as to ensure connectivity with all countries in the region.
4. The country should put more efforts on collection of revenue and seek assistance from donors to assist in infrastructure construction.
5. Training of manpower in various fields of transportation sector like pilots, cabin crew,  mechanics, civil engineers etc.
6. Keeping sufficient oil reserves in order to stay self with the effect of oil fluctuation
7. The advancement of science and technology
